Supporting_Documentation/hila5spec.pdf

	Specification of the HILA5 KEM and Public Key Encryption algorithm.	
	Organized per NIST's call for post-quantum proposals.

	MIT License (which is very permissive). Applies to all code

KAT/PQCkemKAT_1824.req
KAT/PQCkemKAT_1824.rsp

	NIST Known Answer Test (KAT) data, automatically generated.


KAT/src/PQCgenKAT_kem.c
KAT/src/rng.h
KAT/src/rng.c

	Code to generate KAT files (used by testing code) from NIST. 
	Slightly modified to eliminate some warnings.


Reference_Implementation/api.h
Reference_Implementation/kem.c
Reference_Implementation/hila5_sha3.h
Reference_Implementation/hila5_sha3.c
Reference_Implementation/Makefile

	Tiny C99 Reference implementation. This is really slow and should 
	not be used for production. For testing, you may try "make test", 
	which will generate KEM files and compare those with the real ones.


Optimized_Implementation/api.h
Optimized_Implementation/kem.c
Optimized_Implementation/hila5_sha3.h
Optimized_Implementation/hila5_sha3.c
Optimized_Implementation/ms_ntt.c
Optimized_Implementation/ms_priv.h
Optimized_Implementation/ms_ntt_const.c
Optimized_Implementation/Makefile

	C99 Optimized implementaion, which uses the proper NTT algorithms.
	Here you may also do a "make test."
